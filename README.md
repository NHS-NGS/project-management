Documents that should help us manage projects

## Capturing project requirements

The [project requirements template](requirements-template.md) provides a loose starting point for gathering information about a project. Generally, this should help create a *brief* document that outlines expected outcomes for the product being built. Tasks to achieve those outcomes should be captured in a task/issue tracking tool such as Asana or Github Issues.

Reviewing examples of completed requirements docs can be useful.

You may wish to conduct user research prior to creating this requirements doc - https://github.com/NHS-NGS/project-management/blob/master/user_research.md

Information on functional and non-functional requirements (a functional requirement describes what a software system should do, while non-functional requirements place constraints on how the system will do so) - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16475979/what-is-the-difference-between-functional-and-non-functional-requirement

## Why

Attempt to avoid duplicated efforts across labs and [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) within projects

## How to use

1. Make copy of requirements template and complete basic fields specific to your project

2. Share with stake holders to specify requirements for project

3. Agree set of final requirements and [acceptance criteria](http://nomad8.com/acceptance_criteria/). Update approval status. 

The requirements doc may require a few rounds of iteration before it is finalised and in particular the scope of the project should be agreed.
