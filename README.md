Documents that should help us manage projects

## Capturing project requirements

The [project requirements template](requirements-template.md) provides a loose starting point for gathering information about a project. Generally, this should help create a *brief* document that outlines expected outcomes for the product being built. Tasks to achieve those outcomes should be captured in a task/issue tracking tool such as Asana or Github Issues.

## Why

Attempt to avoid duplicated efforts across labs and [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) within projects

## How to use

1. Make copy of requirements template and complete basic fields specific to your project

2. Share with stake holders to specify requirements for project

3. Agree set of final requirements and acceptance criteria. Update approval status
