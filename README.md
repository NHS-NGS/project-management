Documents that should help us manage projects

## Capturing project requirements

The [project requirements template](requirements-template.md) provides a loose starting point for gathering information about a project. Generally, this should help create a *brief* document that outlines expected outcomes for the product being built. Tasks to achieve those outcomes should be captured in a task/issue tracking tool such as Asana or Github Issues.
